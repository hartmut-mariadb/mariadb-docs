# Upgrading from MariaDB 10.1 to MariaDB 10.2

### How to Upgrade

For Windows, see [Upgrading MariaDB on Windows](../upgrading-mariadb-on-windows.md) instead.

For MariaDB Galera Cluster, see [Upgrading with Galera Cluster](https://app.gitbook.com/s/3VYeeVGUV4AMqrA3zwy7/galera-management/upgrading-galera-cluster) instead.

Before you upgrade, it would be best to take a backup of your database. This is always a good idea to do before an upgrade. We would recommend [mariadb-backup](../../../../server-usage/backup-and-restore/mariadb-backup/mariadb-backup-overview.md).

The suggested upgrade procedure is:

1. Modify the repository configuration, so the system's package manager installs [MariaDB 10.2](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-2-series/what-is-mariadb-102). For example,

* On Debian, Ubuntu, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Updating the MariaDB APT repository to a New Major Release](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/installing-mariadb-deb-files.md#updating-the-mariadb-apt-repository-to-a-new-major-release) for more information.
* On RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Updating the MariaDB YUM repository to a New Major Release](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/rpm/yum.md#updating-the-mariadb-yum-repository-to-a-new-major-release) for more information.
* On SLES, OpenSUSE, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Updating the MariaDB ZYpp repository to a New Major Release](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/rpm/installing-mariadb-with-zypper.md#updating-the-mariadb-zypp-repository-to-a-new-major-release) for more information.

1. Set [innodb\_fast\_shutdown](../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables.md#innodb_fast_shutdown) to `0`. It can be changed dynamically with [SET GLOBAL](../../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/replication-statements/set-global-sql_slave_skip_counter.md). For example:`SET GLOBAL innodb_fast_shutdown=0;`

* This step is not necessary when upgrading to [MariaDB 10.2.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-2-series/mariadb-1025-release-notes) or later. Omitting it can make the upgrade process far faster. See [MDEV-12289](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-12289) for more information.

1. [Stop MariaDB](../../../starting-and-stopping-mariadb/starting-and-stopping-mariadb-automatically.md).
2. Uninstall the old version of MariaDB.

* On Debian, Ubuntu, and other similar Linux distributions, execute the following:`sudo apt-get remove mariadb-server`
* On RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, and other similar Linux distributions, execute the following:`sudo yum remove MariaDB-server`
* On SLES, OpenSUSE, and other similar Linux distributions, execute the following:`sudo zypper remove MariaDB-server`

1. Install the new version of MariaDB.

* On Debian, Ubuntu, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Installing MariaDB Packages with APT](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/installing-mariadb-deb-files.md#installing-mariadb-packages-with-apt) for more information.
* On RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Installing MariaDB Packages with YUM](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/rpm/yum.md#installing-mariadb-packages-with-yum) for more information.
* On SLES, OpenSUSE, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Installing MariaDB Packages with ZYpp](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/rpm/installing-mariadb-with-zypper.md#installing-mariadb-packages-with-zypp) for more information.

1. Make any desired changes to configuration options in [option files](../../configuring-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md), such as `my.cnf`. This includes removing any options that are no longer supported.
2. [Start MariaDB](../../../starting-and-stopping-mariadb/starting-and-stopping-mariadb-automatically.md).
3. Run [mysql\_upgrade](../../../../clients-and-utilities/legacy-clients-and-utilities/mysql_upgrade.md).

* `mysql_upgrade` does two things:
  1. Ensures that the system tables in the `[mysq](../../../../reference/sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/the-mysql-database-tables/README.md) l` database are fully compatible with the new version.
  2. Does a very quick check of all tables and marks them as compatible with the new version of MariaDB .

### Incompatible Changes Between 10.1 and 10.2

On most servers upgrading from 10.1 should be painless. However, there are some things that have changed which could affect an upgrade:

#### InnoDB Instead of XtraDB

[MariaDB 10.2](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-2-series/what-is-mariadb-102) uses [InnoDB](../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/) as the default storage engine, rather than XtraDB, used in [MariaDB 10.1](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-1-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-10-1) and before. See [Why does MariaDB 10.2 use InnoDB instead of XtraDB?](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-server/blob/test/kb/en/why-does-mariadb-102-use-innodb-instead-of-xtradb/README.md) In most cases this should have minimal effect as the latest InnoDB has incorporated most of the improvements made in earlier versions of XtraDB. Note that certain [XtraDB system variables](../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables.md) are now ignored (although they still exist so as to permit easy upgrading).

#### Options That Have Changed Default Values

In particular, take note of the changes to [innodb\_strict\_mode](../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables.md), [sql\_mode](../../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#sql_mode), [binlog\_format](../../../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/replication-and-binary-log-system-variables.md), [binlog\_checksum](../../../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/replication-and-binary-log-system-variables.md) and [innodb\_checksum\_algorithm](../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables.md).

| [innodb\_use\_sys\_malloc](../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables.md)            | Deprecated in [MariaDB 10.0](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-0-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-10-0).                                                                                                      |

#### Reserved Words

New [reserved words](../../../../reference/sql-structure/sql-language-structure/reserved-words.md): OVER, RECURSIVE and ROWS. These can no longer be used as [identifiers](../../../../reference/sql-structure/sql-language-structure/identifier-names.md) without being quoted.

#### TokuDB

[TokuDB](../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/legacy-storage-engines/tokudb/) has been split into a separate package, mariadb-plugin-tokudb.

#### Replication

[Replication](../../../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/) from legacy MySQL servers may require setting [binlog\_checksum](../../../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/replication-and-binary-log-system-variables.md) to NONE.

#### SQL Mode

[SQL\_MODE](../../../variables-and-modes/sql-mode.md) has been changed; in particular, NOT NULL fields with no default will no longer fall back to a dummy value for inserts which do not specify a value for that field.

#### Auto\_increment

[Auto\_increment](../../../../reference/data-types/auto_increment.md) columns are no longer permitted in [CHECK constraints](../../../../reference/sql-statements/data-definition/constraint.md), [DEFAULT value expressions](../../../../reference/sql-statements/data-definition/create/create-table.md#default) and [virtual columns](../../../../reference/sql-statements/data-definition/create/generated-columns.md). They were permitted in earlier versions, but did not work correctly.

#### TLS

Starting with [MariaDB 10.2](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-2-series/what-is-mariadb-102), when the user specifies the `--ssl` option with a [client or utility](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-server/blob/test/kb/en/clients-utilities/README.md), the [client or utility](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-server/blob/test/kb/en/clients-utilities/README.md) will not [verify the server certificate](../../../../security/securing-mariadb/encryption/data-in-transit-encryption/secure-connections-overview.md#server-certificate-verification) by default. In order to verify the server certificate, the user must specify the `--ssl-verify-server-cert` option to the [client or utility](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-server/blob/test/kb/en/clients-utilities/README.md). For more information, see the [list of options](../../../../clients-and-utilities/mariadb-client/mysql-command-line-client.md#options) for the [mysql](../../../../clients-and-utilities/mariadb-client/mysql-command-line-client.md) client.
