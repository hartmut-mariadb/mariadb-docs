# MariaDB MCP Server 1.0.0 Release Notes

The MariaDB MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server is a secure, enterprise-grade application designed to act as the primary interface between AI assistants and MariaDB data ecosystems. It provides a standardized way for AI systems to interact with databases, vector stores, and RAG workflows through the Model Context Protocol.

The MCP Server is an extension of the existing community MCP Server with authentication as well as new RAG functionality, providing a single endpoint for AI-driven data interactions with MariaDB.

We plan to do multiple releases of this tech preview to continue to improve the system and incorporate feedback from users.
