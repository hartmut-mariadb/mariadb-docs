# Deployment

You can deploy MariaDB Exa in one of the following ways.

## Proof of Concept via Docker or Community Exasol

For testing or proof-of-concept environments, Exasol can be deployed (via Docker or Virtual Box with an OVA file).

This mode simplifies setup, but does not provide MPP[^1] benefits, high availability or real performance testing. These options are limited to using 2 VCPU[^2]s and 200G of data, and come with MariaDB's CDC[^3] solution and MaxScale integration.

## Clustered MPP Deployment

In production, MariaDB Exa is deployed as a cluster of nodes.

* Minimum 3 node deployments of 16 VCPUs, 256 GB RAM nodes.
* Optional standby nodes for High Availability.

Data is automatically distributed across nodes, using MariaDB Exa internal partitioning and replication for fault tolerance.
