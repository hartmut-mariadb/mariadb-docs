# Monitoring and Observability

Explore essential tools and techniques for monitoring and optimizing data systems and workflows:

* **Debezium & Kafka Connect Logs:** Check for commit lag and schema registry errors.
* **Exasol GUI:** Monitor cluster health, node status, and I/O throughput.
* **SQL Auditing:** Use Exasol system tables (EXA\_STATISTICS, EXA\_ALL\_SESSIONS) for query profiling.
* **Grafana / Prometheus Integration:** Collect metrics across Kafka, Debezium, and Exasol.
* **MariaDB Enterprise Manager:** Review operational statistics and metrics covering all MariaDB products except MariaDB Exa.
