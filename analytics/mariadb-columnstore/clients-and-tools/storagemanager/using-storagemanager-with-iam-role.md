# Using StorageManager With IAM Role

## AWS IAM Role Configuration

From Columnstore 5.5.2, you can use AWS IAM roles in order to connect to S3 buckets without explicitly entering credentials into the `storagemanager.cnf` config file.

You need to modify the IAM role of your Amazon EC2 instance to allow for this. Please follow the AWS [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html) before beginning this process.

It is important to note that you must update the AWS S3 endpoint based on your chosen region; otherwise, you might face delays in propagation as discussed [here](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=552808) and [here](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=801522).

For a complete list of AWS service endpoints, visit the AWS [reference guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html).

## Sample Configuration

Edit your **Storage Manager** configuration file located at _`/etc/columnstore/storagemanager.cnf`_ in order to look similar to the example below (replacing those in the \[S3] section with your own custom variables):

```ini
[ObjectStorage]
service = S3
object_size = 5M
metadata_path = /var/lib/columnstore/storagemanager/metadata
journal_path = /var/lib/columnstore/storagemanager/journal
max_concurrent_downloads = 21
max_concurrent_uploads = 21
common_prefix_depth = 3

[S3]
ec2_iam_mode=enabled
bucket = my_mcs_bucket
region = us-west-2
endpoint = s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com

[LocalStorage]
path = /var/lib/columnstore/storagemanager/fake-cloud
fake_latency = n
max_latency = 50000

[Cache]
cache_size = 2g
path = /var/lib/columnstore/storagemanager/cache
```
