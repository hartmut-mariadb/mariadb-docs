# ColumnStore System Monitoring Configuration

## Overview

ColumnStore is designed to be self-managing and self-healing to some extent. The following two processes achieve this:

* **ProcMon** runs on each node and is responsible for ensuring that the other required ColumnStore processes are started and automatically restarted as appropriate on that server. This in turn is started and monitored by the run.sh shell script which ensures it is restarted should it be killed. The run.sh script is invoked and automatically started by the columnstore systemd service at bootup time. This can also be utilized to restart the service on an individual node though generally it is preferred to use the mcsadmin stop, shutdown, and start commands from the PM1 node.
* **ProcMgr** runs on each PM node with only one taking an active role at a time, the others remaining in warm standby mode. This process manager is responsible for overall system health, resource monitoring, and PM node failover management.

To provide additional monitoring guarantees, an external monitoring tool should monitor the health of these processes. If the `run.sh` process fails, the system is at potential risk of not being able to self-heal.

## System Monitoring Configuration

A number of system configuration variables exist to allow fine-tuning of the system monitoring capabilities. The default values work well for many cases.

The configuration parameters are maintained in the `/usr/local/mariadb/columnstore/etc/Columnstore.xml file`. In a multiple server deployment, these should only be edited on the PM1 server as this will be automatically replicated to other servers by the system. A system restart will be required for the configuration change to take effect.

The  `getConfig` and `setConfig` utility programs are available to safely update the `Columnstore.xm`l file without requiring familiarity with editing XML files. The `-h` argument displays usage information. The section value is `SystemConfig` for all settings in this document:

```
# ./setConfig SystemConfig ModuleHeartbeatPeriod 5
# ./getConfig SystemConfig ModuleHeartbeatPeriod
5
```

### Module Heartbeats

Heartbeat monitoring occurs between modules (both [UM](../../architecture/columnstore-user-module.md) and [PM](../../architecture/columnstore-performance-module.md)) to determine if the module is up and functioning. The module heartbeat settings are the same for all modules.

1. **ModuleHeartbeatPeriod** refers to how often the heartbeat test is performed. For example, if you set the period to `5`, the heartbeat test is performed every 5 seconds. The initial default value is `1`. To disable heartbeat monitoring set the value to `-1`.
2. **ModuleHeartbeatCount** refers to how many failures in a row must take place before a fault is processed. The initial default value is `3`.

### Disk Threshold

Thresholds can be set to trigger a local alert when file system usage crosses a specified percentage of a file system on a server. Critical, Major or Minor thresholds can be set for the disk usage for each server. However, it is recommended to use an external system monitoring tool configured to monitor for free disk space to perform proactive external alerting or paging. Actual columnstore data is stored within the _data_ directories of the installation and MariaDB DB files are stored under the _`mysql/db`_` ``directory`.

1. ExternalMinorThreshold - Percentage threshold for when a minor local alarm is triggered. Default value is 70.
2. ExternalMajorThreshold - Percentage threshold for when a minor local alarm is triggered. Default value is 80.
3. ExternalCriticalThreshold - Percentage threshold for when a minor local alarm is triggered. Default value is 90.

The value is a numeric percentage value between 0 and 100. To disable a particular threshold, use value 0.\
To disable a threshold alarm, set it to 0.

### Memory Utilization

A couple of mcsadmin commands provide convenience functions for monitoring memory utilization across nodes. `getSystemMemory` returns server-level memory statistics.  `getSystemMemoryUsers` shows the top 5 processes by server.&#x20;

The following examples are for a 2-server combined setup:

```sql
mcsadmin> getSystemMemory

## Viewing Storage Configuration

To view the storage configuration, use the _`getStorageConfig`_ command in [mcsadmin](../../columnstore-quickstart-guides/mariadb-columnstore-usage-guide.md#mcsadmin), or simply use [mcsadmin](../../columnstore-quickstart-guides/mariadb-columnstore-usage-guide.md#mcsadmin) _`getStorageConfig`_ from the operating system prompt. This will provide information on DBRoots and which PrimProc[^1] modules they are assigned to, if any:

```
# mcsadmin getstorageconfig Wed Mar 28 10:40:34 2016

System Storage Configuration

Storage Type = internal
System DBRoot count = 6
DBRoot IDs assigned to 'pm1' = 1
DBRoot IDs assigned to 'pm2' = 2
DBRoot IDs assigned to 'pm3' = 3
DBRoot IDs assigned to 'pm4' = 4
DBRoot IDs assigned to 'pm5' = 5
DBRoot IDs assigned to 'pm6' = 6
```

## Module Monitoring Configuration

An internal alarm system is used to keep track of internal notable events as a convenience or reference point. It is recommended to use a dedicated system monitoring tool for more proactive alerting of critical CPU, memory, or disk utilization issues for each of the servers.

Alarms are logged to the `/var/log/mariadb/columnstore/alarm.log` file and a summary is displayed in mcsadmin. The `getActiveAlarms` command in `mcsadmin` can be used to retrieve current alarm conditions.

For each PrimProc[^1] module, the following resource monitoring parameters can be configured:

| Resource Monitoring Parameter  | mcsadmin command                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CPU thresholds                 | setModuleTypeConfig (module name) ModuleCPU(Clear/ Minor/Major/Critical)Threshold n (where n= percentage of CPU usage)   |
| Disk file system use threshold | setModuleTypeConfig (module name) ModuleDisk(Minor/ Major/Critical)Threshold n (where n= percentage of disk system used) |
| Module swap thresholds         | setModuleTypeConfig (module name) ModuleSwap(Minor/ Major/Critical) Threshold n (where n= percentage of swap space used) |

### Alarm Trigger Count Threshold

For an alarm, a threshold can be set for how many times the alarm can be triggered in 30 minutes. The default threshold is `100`.

```sql
setAlarmConfig (alarmID#) Threshold n
```

(where n= maximum number of times an alarm can be triggered in 30 minutes),

Example to change Alarm ID 22's threshold to 50:

```
# mcsadmin setAlarmConfig 22 Threshold 50
```

### Clearing Alarms

The _`resetAlarm`_ command is used to clear and acknowledge the issue is resolved. The _`resetAlarm`_ command can be invoked with the argument ALL to clear all outstanding local alarms.

### Automated Restart Based on Excessive Swapping

By default, ColumnStore restarts a server in case swap space utilization exceeds the configured module swap major threshold (default is `80%`). At this point, the system will likely be nearly unusable â€” so this is an attempt to recover from very large queries or data loads. The behavior can be configured with the `SystemConfig` section configuration variable `SwapAction`, which contains the `oam` command to be run if the threshold is exceeded. The default value is `restartSystem` but it can be set to `none` which disables the default behavior. The fact that swap space overuse has happened can be determined by a log entry similar to this one:

```sql
Nov 01 11:23:13 [ServerMonitor] 13.306324 |0|0|0| C 09 CAL0000: Swap Space usage over Major threashold, perform OAM command restartSystem
```

## Logging-Level Management

There are five levels of logging in MariaDB ColumnStore:

* Critical
* Error
* Warning
* Info
* Debug

Application log files are written to `/var/log/mariadb/columnstore` on each server. Log rotation and archiving is configured to manage these automatically. To get details about current logging configuration, issue this command:

```
# mcsadmin getlogconfig
getlogconfig   Wed Oct 19 06:58:47 2016

MariaDB Columnstore System Log Configuration Data

System Logging Configuration File being used: /etc/rsyslog.d/49-columnstore.conf

Module    Configured Log Levels
------    ---------------------------------------
pm1       Critical Error Warning Info
```

The system-logging configuration file referenced is a standard syslog configuration file and may be edited to enable and or disable specific levels, for example to disable debug logging and to only log at the specific level in each file:

```sql
# cat /etc/rsyslog.d/49-columnstore.conf
# MariaDb Columnstore Database Platform Logging
local1.=crit -/var/log/mariadb/columnstore/crit.log
local1.=err -/var/log/mariadb/columnstore/err.log
local1.=warning -/var/log/mariadb/columnstore/warning.log
local1.=info -/var/log/mariadb/columnstore/info.log
```

After making changes to this restart the syslog process, like this:

```
# systemctl restart rsyslog
```

Log rotation and archiving are also configured by the installer and the settings for this may be found and managed similarly in `/etc/logrotate.d/columnstore`. If the current log files are manually deleted, restart the syslog process to resume logging.
