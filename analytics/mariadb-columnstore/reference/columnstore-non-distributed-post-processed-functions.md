# ColumnStore Non-Distributed Post-Processed Functions

## Overview

ColumnStore supports all MariaDB functions that can be used in a post-processing manner where data is returned by ColumnStore first and then MariaDB executes the function on the data returned. The functions are currently supported only in the projection (`SELECT`) and `ORDER BY` portions of the SQL statement.
