# ColumnStore Naming Conventions

## Overview

This lists the different naming conventions enforced by the column store, compared to the normal [MariaDB naming conventions](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-structure/sql-language-structure/identifier-names).

* Usernames: 64 characters (MariaDB has 80)
* Table and column names are restricted to alphanumeric and underscore only, i.e. "A-Z a-z 0-9 \_".
* The first character of all table and column names should be an `ASCII` letter (a-z A-Z).
* ColumnStore reserves certain words that MariaDB does not, such as `SELECT`, `CHAR` and `TABLE`, so even wrapped in backticks these cannot be used.

## Reserved Words

In addition to MariaDB Server [reserved words](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-structure/sql-language-structure/reserved-words), ColumnStore has additional reserved words that cannot be used as table names, column names or user defined variables, functions or stored procedure names.
