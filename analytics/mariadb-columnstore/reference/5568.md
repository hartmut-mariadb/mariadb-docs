# ColumnStore Commit

The `COMMIT` statement makes changes to a table permanent. You should only commit changes after you have verified the integrity of the changed data. Once data is committed, it cannot be undone with the `ROLLBACK` statement. To return the database to its former state, you must restore the data from backups.
