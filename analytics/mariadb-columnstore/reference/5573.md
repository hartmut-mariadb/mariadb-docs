# ColumnStore Rename Table

The `RENAME TABLE` statement renames one or more ColumnStore tables.

Notes:

* You cannot currently use `RENAME TABLE` to move a table from one database to another.
* See the `ALTER TABLE` syntax for an alternative to `RENAME Table`. The following statement renames the orders table:

```sql
RENAME TABLE orders TO customer_order;
```

The following statement renames both the _orders_ table and _customer_ table:

```sql
RENAME TABLE orders TO customer_orders,customer TO customers;
```

You may also use `RENAME TABLE` to swap tables. This example swaps the _customer_ and _vendor_ tables (assuming the _`temp_table`_\
does not already exist):

```sql
RENAME TABLE customer TO temp_table, vendor TO customer,temp_table to vendor;
```
