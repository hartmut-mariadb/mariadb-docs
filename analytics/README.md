# Analytics

## MariaDB ColumnStore

For fast, ad hoc analytics at scale, MariaDB ColumnStore is a powerful columnar database that can be deployed as a standalone analytics solution or integrated with MariaDB Enterprise Server to act as a powerful query accelerator. It stores data in a columnar format and can be distributed across a cluster of servers, allowing it to execute complex queries in parallel on petabytes of data.

This integration allows you to access your InnoDB data in near-real time, processing it directly in the ColumnStore engine to run fast, parallel OLAP queries straight from your transactional data. This eliminates the need to maintain a separate pipeline or use delayed batch inserts to analyze your live data.
