# MariaDB Connector/C Data Structures

This page describes the public data structures used by MariaDB Connector/C.

### MYSQL

The `MYSQL` structure represents one database connection and is used by most of MariaDB Connector/C's API functions. The MYSQL structure needs to be allocated and initialized by the [mysql\_init()](api-functions/mysql_init.md) API function. It will be released by the [mysql\_close()](api-functions/mysql_close.md) function.

{% hint style="info" %}
The `MYSQL` structure should be considered as opaque; copying or changing values of its members might produce unexpected results, errors or program crashes.
{% endhint %}

### MYSQL\_RES

The `MYSQL_RES` structure represents a result set which contains data and metadata information. It will be returned by the [mysql\_use\_result()](api-functions/mysql_use_result.md), [mysql\_store\_result()](api-functions/mysql_store_result.md) and [mysql\_stmt\_result\_metadata()](api-prepared-statement-functions/mysql_stmt_result_metadata.md) API functions and needs to be released by [mysql\_free\_result()](api-functions/mysql_free_result.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
The `MYSQL_RES` structure should be considered as opaque; copying or changing values of its members might produce unexpected results, errors or program crashes.
{% endhint %}

### MYSQL\_ROW

`MYSQL_ROW` represents an array of character pointers, pointing to the columns of the actual data row.\
Data will be received by the [mysql\_fetch\_row()](api-functions/mysql_fetch_row.md) function. The size of the array is the number of columns for the current row.

{% hint style="info" %}
After freeing the result set with [mysql\_free\_result()](api-functions/mysql_free_result.md) `MYSQL_ROW` becomes invalid.
{% endhint %}

### MYSQL\_STMT

The `MYSQL_STMT` structure represents a prepared statement handle and is used by MariaDB Connector/C's prepared statement API functions. The MYSQL\_STMT structure needs to be allocated and initialized by the [mysql\_stmt\_init()](api-prepared-statement-functions/mysql_stmt_init.md) function and needs to be released by the [mysql\_stmt\_close()](api-prepared-statement-functions/mysql_stmt_close.md) function.

{% hint style="info" %}
The `MYSQL_STMT` structure should be considered as opaque; copying or changing values of its members might produce unexpected results, errors or program crashes.
{% endhint %}

### MYSQL\_FIELD

The `MYSQL_FIELD` structure describes the metadata of a column. It can be obtained by the [mysql\_fetch\_field()](api-functions/mysql_fetch_field.md) function.

It has the following members:

|                         |                    |                                             |
